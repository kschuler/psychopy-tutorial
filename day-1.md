## Day 1: Overview & Creating an Exposure Phase

### Before we begin
- Make sure PsychoPy is installed
- Download the files you will need for the tutorial

### Agenda
- Overview (10 mins)
  - Introduce PsychoPy and its builder method
- Demo (30 mins)
  - Planning and storyboarding an experiment
  - Creating the exposure phase of the experiment
- Activity (50 mins)
  - Find a partner or 2 (coding buddy)
  - Plan and storyboard the "try me" experiment
  - Create the exposure phase of the "try me" experiment

### Overview
- PsychoPy is an experiment building software, similiar to E-prime or MATLAB.  It is my preferred metod of creating experiments in the lab because it is (1) free, (2) has great documentation and help, and (3) is actively mantained.

- PsychoPy can be used as a python package for programming experiments, or via a GUI experiment builder that requires little to no programming at all.  Today, we are going to learn how to use the builder method.
- The builder has three main panels: routines, flow, and components.  You build your experiment by adding components to routines (typically trials) and inserting them into a flow (the order you want them to occur in your experiment).  You can use loops around routines or groups of routines for even more flexibility.  I will demonstrate all of these things in a moment.  After the demonstration, you'll create your own experiment with a partner and I'll walk around to answer questions and help.
