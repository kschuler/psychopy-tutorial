## Welcome to the PsychoPy Tutorial

This is a 4-day tutorial designed to teach you to create psycholinguistics experiments using [PsychoPy](http://psychopy.org/about/overview.html), a free experiment building platform.  The tutorial will focus on how to use PsychoPy's experiment [Builder](http://psychopy.org/builder/builder.html#builder) to create expriments, for which no programming is necessary.  By the end of the tutorial, you will be capable of creating most any kind of experiment in PsychoPy on your own.
